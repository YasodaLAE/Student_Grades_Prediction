This repository contains an analysis of student data to predict the factors impacting their grades. We have used several models to identify these features, i.e. Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Trees, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting. First we have used linear regression to predict the scores of the students but since it didn't produce much accuracy, we have categorized the scores to four grades, which makes it quite realistic to categorize the scores to these grades.
